Karthik, I'm currently working on GPU-based optimization for simulations, RAG, and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Past work spans across analog antenna design, speech processing, embedded systems, autonomous UAVs, computer vision, and machine learning(still working) . I enjoy building systems end-to-end and solving hard problems with code.
