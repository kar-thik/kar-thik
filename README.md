I'm `Karthik` I mostly spend my days bashing things on a keyboard, apparently good things come out. I've had the opprtunity to work on a really diverse set of problems in analog antenna design, speech processing, embedded systems, autonoumous UAVs, computer vision and machine learning among others.
